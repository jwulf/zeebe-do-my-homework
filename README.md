# How to get help with Zeebe

Hi, I'm Josh Wulf, Camunda's Developer Advocate for [Zeebe](https://zeebe.io). I am committed to empower developers to be productive and happy creating awesome systems using Zeebe.

I usually work from Brisbane, Australia (GMT +10). I'm available in the [Zeebe Slack](https://zeebe-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/).

Along with the core developers of Zeebe who hang out in the Zeebe Slack, I'm available to help you get up to speed with your Zeebe development. Part of my role is solving these problems not only for you, but also for other developers in the future. The core devs make Zeebe a great orchestration engine for microservices, and I'm accountable for making it easy and fun to program against for developers.

The best way to formulate a question is to provide a "minimal reproducer" that demonstrates the issue that you are having, and send me the link.

Here are two examples that show you a minimal reproducer: 

* [Payload update inconsistent](https://github.com/jwulf/zeebe-reproducer-1)
* [How to use local variables](https://github.com/jwulf/zeebe-variable-isolation-demo) 

A minimal reproducer has the following elements:

* A clear description of the issue.
* The minimum amount of code needed to demonstrate the issue.
* The steps to reproduce it.

I speak JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Go, Java, and Kotlin - so I can easily work with reproducers in those languages. If you are programming in something else like Scala, Haskell, Q#, or Arnold C it may take me a little longer, and I might need to ask some questions to get it to run - but I can figure that out too.

The beauty of a minimal reproducer is that it gives us an unambiguous point of reference, and you might even find you resolve the issue yourself while creating the reproducer (happens to me frequently!).
